# Road-Lane-Line-Detection
This project uses the power of Computer Vision to detect the road lanes. This is used in the autonomous self-driving car systems.
The code includes several types of inputs:
1) Taking the input from a pre-recorded Video and generate another Video with the lanes detected.
2) Taking the input from a pre-recorded Video and streaming the output Video.
3) Taking the input from the WebCam or external Sources and streaming the output
   
 Note:The ROI(region of Interest) for the detection must be set manually,because the camera angle(point-of-view) may change.
